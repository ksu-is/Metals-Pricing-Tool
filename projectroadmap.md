[Preplanning]
- [x] 1) Find 10 feasible repositories to examine on Github.
- [x] 2) Review Repositories to identify ones that are recently updated and are well documented.
- [x] 3) Examine each potential project for a roadmap and well done readme file as well documented projects tend to be the best projets.
- [x] 4) Once 5 well documented projects have been identified attempt to run each project.
- [x] 5) While attempting to run each project, document issues and potential suggestions to the original maintainer.
- [x] 6) If appicable suggest any changes or documentaions improvement to the original maintainer on Github.
- [x] 7) Review the notes on the repositories you selected and choose one to clone for your project.  
[Execution]
- [x] 1) Test and utilize the pull features in Github to be sure changes will reflect correctly in both places.
- [x] 2) Make several edits and double check code is updating correctly in Github.
- [x] 3) Once you have your clone be sure it is located within the KSU IS organization.
- [ ] 4) Compare code of cloned repository to the other final repositories to look for features that might be applicable.
- [ ] 5) Experiment with clone and address issues and the notes you made while selecting it.
- After multiple failed attemps at a viable program to clone for a metals calculator without using expensive APIs or frameworks well beyond my capabilities switch project topic to frogger/crossy road style game.
